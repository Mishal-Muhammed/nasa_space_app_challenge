This ML model predict the FLOOD detection .
about the model it predcit on the base of the rain and the area that effect the previcaly flooded area.
the main features in the model is latitude and logitude on the base to determine the area
this does the ML model to predict how accurate the model is it and it test the data and get the ccuracy of 83% therfore it tells that ML model is predicting is correct and it test the data and find the ML mdel accuracy.
